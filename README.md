#  USGS Dam Removal GeoDeepDive Application 
An application for dam removal built on the GeoDeepDive infrastructure. This project at the top level contains the app-template for GeoDeepDive as well as additional scripts and the modified Stromatolites demo project. 

## Quick Start

The goal of the application template is to query the GDD database to condense the publications that might be related to dam removal science. The results are later used in the modified Stromatolites application.
